  <h3>Business Data </h3>
   <p><b> The City of Seattle </b> provides a dataset of active business licenses
  from 2010 to 2024. Each entry in this dataset holds the various attributes such
  as: </p>

  <ol>
    <ul> Business Legal Name </ul>
    <ul> Ownership Type </ul>
    <ul> NAICS Code </ul>
    <ul> NAICS Description </ul>
    <ul> License Start Date </ul>
    <ul> Zip Code </ul>
  </ol>

  <p> What I found the most interesting is the NAICS Code, which stands for the North American Indsutry Classification System. The code is used by Federal statistical agencies to correctly collect, analuze, and publish data
  to the economy based on each business's industry.
